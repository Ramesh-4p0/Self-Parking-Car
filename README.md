# Self-Parking-Car
A Arduino based Self Parking Car


**Arduino Self-Parking Car**

This GitHub repository contains the source code for an Arduino-based self-parking car. The car is equipped with various sensors and motors to autonomously navigate and park in tight spaces. The project is aimed at demonstrating the application of sensor technology and automation in the field of robotics and vehicle control.

**Project Overview**

The self-parking car project focuses on the development of a robotic vehicle that can autonomously park itself. The car uses various sensors and actuators to sense its environment and perform parking maneuvers. It's a practical example of autonomous navigation and control in robotics.

**Components Used**

The project employs various hardware components, including but not limited to:

- Ultrasonic sensors
- Motors
- Arduino board
- IR sensors
- Camera
- Servo motors

**Project Workflow**

The project works as follows:

1. Ultrasonic sensors are used to measure the distance between the car and obstacles.
2. The Arduino board processes the sensor data and makes decisions based on the car's proximity to obstacles.
3. Motors control the movement of the car, enabling it to navigate and park autonomously.

**Advantages**
- Demonstrates autonomous navigation and control.
- Can be used as a basis for further robotics and automation projects.
